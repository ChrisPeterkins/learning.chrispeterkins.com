# Three.js Learning Repository 🎮

A comprehensive learning repository for mastering Three.js and 3D web development for games.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser

## 📚 Learning Path

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
- ✅ Scene, Camera, Renderer basics
- ✅ Basic geometries and meshes
- ✅ Simple animations

### Phase 2: Visual Enhancement (Week 3-4)
- Lighting and shadows
- Materials and textures
- 3D model loading

### Phase 3: Interactivity (Week 5-6)
- Camera controls
- Raycasting
- User input handling

### Phase 4: Game Development (Week 7-8)
- Physics integration
- Collision detection
- Game state management

## 🎯 Examples Structure

Each example folder contains:
- `index.html` - The HTML structure
- `[name].js` - The Three.js implementation
- Comments explaining key concepts

## 🛠️ Key Technologies

- **Three.js** - 3D graphics library
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server
- **dat.GUI** - Debug UI controls
